<!--
Create an array of objects, where each object represents a book with the following
properties title (string), author (string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating whether it has been read or not).
Iterate through all the objects in the array and for each object print the author, the name of the book, and
based on whether it has been read or not, print an appropriate message.
Ex.
'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien'
'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
